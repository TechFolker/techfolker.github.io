## Welcome to the TechFolker blog!
I'm glad to see you here! My name is Bob and... I am programmer :smile:  
I like games, programming and everything related to customization. My favourite
text editors are *Vim* and *Atom* and I love <span style="border-bottom: dashed 1px grey; cursor: help;" title="Free Open Source Software">**FOSS**</span>

I also think, that everything (at least almost everything), that we use should be customized.
By customization, you place a piece of yourself in some item. That item become unique, created
by you and only you. And it's now really *your* item. You made it be what it is now.

This blog is about games (especially open source) and customization. Here I'll show how
to make mods for games and use them.

The format of blog is mostly textual. Description of ingame happenings, code listings,
plots and screenshots. Videos may be present to demonstrate some dynamic stuff (like effects) or
process of creation artistic things (like 3D models, textures etc).  
**Prepare for exciting adventure into the world of creation!**
